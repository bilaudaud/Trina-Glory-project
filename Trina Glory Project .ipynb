    "Since the most important step in a semi-supervised learning problem is getting the data ready\n",
    "(turning it into numbers), that's what we're going to start with.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to go through the following implementation workflow:\n",

    "    1. Get data ready. (Provide the data ready from the Doctor or give permissions on how to\n",
    "         access it)\n",
    "         This data might come is structure or unstructured format (csv, excel, json, jpg, pdf). In\n",
    "         any machine learning project, no matter the format of the data, we need to convert it\n",
    "         into numbers so the machine can understand. Since most machine learning algorithm\n",
    "         are built on core mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Prepare the data. (preprocessing, the sets, X & y)\n",
    "         For preprocessing our data, we're going to use the latest version of Scikit-learn\n",
    "         preprocessing libraries. The whole premise here is to get our data into Tensors (arrays of\n",
    "         numbers which can be run on GPUs) and then allow a machine learning model to find\n",
    "         patterns between them. This is where I will need you and I to work together. We need\n",
    "         to prepare the data before feeding our model. Feature engineering is very important\n",
    "         here. Like I said, I am not in the Health line. I will need someone who could interpret\n",
    "         things to me. This process takes time and this is where most work is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Choose and fit/train a model (Sklearn, TensorFlow Hub, tf.keras.applications,\n",
    "         TensorBoard, EarlyStopping, Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab).\n",
    "         For our machine learning model, we're going to be using a pretrained machine learning\n",
    "         model from Scikit-Learn. There are several models available for us to make use. The\n",
    "         Scikit learn organizations has provided many machine learning models for us. We will try\n",
    "         several models and we go for the one that gives is the best result. Better still, we could\n",
    "         create a pipeline of several models.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Evaluating a model (making predictions, comparing them with the ground truth labels).\n",
    "         This is where we test our implemented model if it can work on data it hasnâ€™t seen\n",
    "         before.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. Improve the model through experimentation (start with 1000 or more datasets, make\n",
    "         sure it works, increase the number of data if possible).\n",
    "\n",
    "    6. Save, sharing and reloading your model (once you're happy with the results). Essential\n",
    "libraries needed are (Joblib, pickle)\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "To work through these `PROJECT`, we'll use pandas, Matplotlib and NumPy for data anaylsis, as well as, Scikit-Learn for machine learning and modelling tasks.\n",

    "Tools which can be used for each step of the machine learning modelling process. \n",

    "We'll have a trained machine learning model which predicts?????"
